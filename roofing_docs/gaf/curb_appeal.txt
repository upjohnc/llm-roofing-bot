All homes can benefit from a little tender loving care, no matter the age or location. Making occasional updates to beautify your property can help maintain its character while enhancing your pride and appreciation. In some cases, home improvement projects can even boost the resale value.

If you want to upgrade the look of your home and green spaces without getting on the roof or breaking the bank, there's no shortage of options. Here are four DIY ideas for low-maintenance front yard curb appeal.
1. A Fresh Coat of Paint

Painting is one of the simplest and least costly DIY home projects, requiring only primer, paint, and a brush. In fact, the most complicated part of painting projects is often choosing what to paint and what colors to use. However, this can be one of the highest-impact, low-maintenance front yard curb appeal projects.

Painting your shutters, trim, or even just your front door can give your home a quick facelift. A great way to make your home look as cohesive as possible is to stick to its existing colors and undertones. You can achieve this by keeping the trim or shutter colors within the same color family as your roof.

For example, if you have a white home with Hunter Green GAF Timberline HDZ速 shingles on the roof, consider a similar shade of green for the shutters and trim. Or, if you have a stucco house with a cooler-hued roof, you can paint your shutters a soft gray or light blue for a modest pop of color.

If you're feeling adventurous, consider painting your front door a fun color that will catch the eye and welcome your guests. For cooler-toned homes, try a front door in navy, royal, or even sky blue. For warmer-toned homes, you can be extra playful and paint your front door a bright red.

When painting, remember to properly prep and prime all surfaces and use exterior paint. If you plan to refresh your shutters, it's best to remove them from the hinges and lay them flat while working.
2. Updated Landscaping

Landscaping is another fun way to add front yard curb appeal, but it can feel a little more daunting than an afternoon of painting. To start, visit your local nursery and learn about suitable plants for your area. Figure out how much upkeep and irrigation certain shrubs require, when particular flowers bloom, and the amount of sunshine each plant needs. You may want to dot your landscape with bushes that bloom throughout the year, or you may want a simple and calming lawn filled with lush shades of green. Either way, an expert at your local nursery can help.

However, if you only have one afternoon to dedicate to your landscape, you can still make an impact. One quick way to upgrade your property's look is to fill terracotta pots with seasonal flowers in your favorite colors. Place them flanking the front door or beside the mailbox. If your home has a lot of windows, plant beautiful, low-maintenance flowers in windowsill boxes. The best part about potted plants is they're transportable, and you can change the blooms with the season or your mood.

As you update your landscaping, choose a color scheme and appearance that complements your home's style and design. If you have a more traditional home with brown Weathered Wood GAF Timberline UHDZ速 shingles on the roof, for instance, you could create a rustic, English-style garden that's filled with bursts of colorful flowers. If your home is more modern, on the other hand, stick with a simple landscape design that uses a subdued color palette. You want your front yard to feel connected with the rest of your home.

3. Improved Walkway Design

Another DIY project that can give your home low-maintenance front yard curb appeal is improving your walkway. Enhancing your yard's hardscaping can make your home feel more cohesive.

If your property has existing gravel walkways, consider matching the color to your home. Gray gravel stones complement a cooler-toned home, and ivory/beige stones work well for a warm-toned home. For instance, if your roof is a color similar to Oyster Grey GAF Timberline HDZ速 shingles, consider using slate or bluestone; if it's on the warmer side, use brick.

If you like the look of paver stones, pick up lightweight options at your local hardware store and use them to create intricate, eye-catching designs.

4. Elegant Lighting

An impactful DIY tip for jazzing up your home's curb appeal is upgrading your exterior lighting. Soft, warm lighting can add elegance and offer dramatic flair. This complements homes with GAF Timberline速 NS shingles that provide a natural shadow effect.

Consider adding a sconce by the front door to make your home feel inviting and cozy. Place outdoor solar-powered lights along walkways. You can also add solar lights at the base of trees to uplight them, creating a sophisticated look at night. As added benefits, solar lights require no hard-wiring and don't affect your electricity bill, which makes them a great low-maintenance front yard curb appeal addition.
There's No Place Like Your Home

Giving your home upgraded curb appeal through painting, landscaping, hardscaping, and lighting can make a big difference without requiring too much time or money. In addition to giving you a newfound sense of pride, your neighbors may also appreciate the property's updates. Best of all, these exterior DIY projects can potentially increase your home's sale price. It's often easier for buyers to envision themselves in a beautiful, well-maintained home.
